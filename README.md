# texthighlighter
* a typescript port of https://github.com/mir3z/texthighlighter because typescript is amazing. Some bugs were even fixed by just converting to typescript. Functions were converted to not need class instantiation. Followed article https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c on setting up a typescript package after testing my port on my own project. Pull requests are welcome!

## todo
* [x] convert library to typescript
  * works where it's being used (in a vue ts project)
* [ ] bring over demos and examples
* [ ] improve unit tests
